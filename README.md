## General Information
This project is a fun and interactive project that allows users to have the power to change the weather based on their personal preference. I thought this would be an interesting and fun project to undertake to broaden my knowledge and understanding in coding specifically Processing in Python.


## Technologies Used
Processing (Python Mode)

## Features
- The main house image with the placement of everything including the text and buttons
- Rain button: was the first button I created
- Creating the lightning bolt shape using createShape() and vertex()

## Screenshots


## Setup
To get started with the project all you need to do is click the play button in the Processing Python code provided. 

## Usage


## Project Status
Project is : Complete

## Room for Improvement
While I am extremely proud and happy of the result I created, there is always room for improvement. Here are some:
- More detailed elements e.g. house, trees etc.
- Rain making ripples on the ground and snow piling up after a while

To do:
- Instead of just the sky changing colour when a button is rpessed, make everything else related like the state of the trees, house etc.
- More weather buttons e.g. sunny, cloudy, hail, rainbow
  
## Acknowledgements
This project was initially inspired by Waclaw Szpakowski and his artistic patterns using lines. 
Many thanks to my friends who study code and helped me heaps: Benny and Carly.
