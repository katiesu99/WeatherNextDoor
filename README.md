## General Information
This project is a fun and interactive project that allows users to have the power to change the weather based on their personal preference. I thought this would be an interesting and fun project to undertake to broaden my knowledge and understanding in coding specifically Processing in Python.


## Technologies Used
Processing (Python Mode)

## Features
- The main house image with the placement of everything including the text and buttons
- Rain button: was the first button I created
- Creating the lightning bolt shape using createShape() and vertex()

My main page with the house and weather buttons

## Setup
To install this project, click on the attached file called WeatherNextDoor and open it. 

## Usage
To see the project in motion, all you need to do is click the play button in the Processing Python code provided.

## Project Status
Project is : In Progress

## Room for Improvement
While I am extremely proud and happy of the result I created, there is always room for improvement. Here are some:
- Find the error/problem with the lightning functions 
- More detailed elements e.g. house, car, trees etc. as well as adding more elements to make it less sparse
- Instead of just the sky changing colour when a button is pressed, make everything else related like the state of the trees, car, house etc.
  
To do/add in the future:
- Rain making ripples on the ground and snow piling up after a while
- More weather buttons e.g. sunny, cloudy, hail, rainbow
  
## Acknowledgements
This project was initially inspired by Waclaw Szpakowski and his artistic patterns using lines. 
The Processing website of the basic examples was an extreme help during the entirety of my project.
Many thanks to my friends who study code and helped me heaps: Benny and Carly.
